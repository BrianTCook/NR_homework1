\subsection{Part B}

We are given the halo mass for 5 haloes and in 3A we compute the optimal values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the distribution of satellites follows the prescribed number density profile $n(x)$. Na\"{i}vely I would suspect that a linear interpolator could be applied for a new halo with mass $M$ such that

\begin{align}
M_{i} &< M < M_{j}, \\
\mat{p} &= {1\over 2} \left(\mat{p}_{i} + \mat{p}_{j}\right),
\end{align}

where $\mat{p}$ is the interpolated parameter vector $\mat{p} = (a,b,c)$. The accuracy of this interpolator would improve with more haloes; we only have five to work with so this would be a pretty crude interpolator.
