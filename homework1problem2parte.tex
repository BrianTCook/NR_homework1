\subsection{Part E}

See Figure \ref{fig:12e1} for a comparison of the expected number of satellites within a range $\Delta x$,

\begin{align}
N(x)\Delta x &= n(x) \times 4\pi x^{2} \, \Delta x,
\end{align}

with the distribution determined from the codes made in the previous parts that create an arbitrary number of satellites. In this case we have $10^{5}$ satellites that are being put into radial bins. The distribution is not as good as we would expect and that could be attributed to the not very sophisticated method with which I sampled values of $x$.
