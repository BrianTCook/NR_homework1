\subsection{Part F}

In this section we are tasked with finding the values of $x$ such that

\begin{align}
N(x) &= {1\over 2} N_{max}.
\end{align}

To achieve this we can find the roots of the equation $N(x) - {1\over 2}N_{max} = 0$ using the Newton-Raphson method. As long as the initial guesses are suitable the iteration

\begin{align}
x_{i+1} &= x_{i} - {f(x_{i}) \over f'(x_{i})}
\end{align}

will converge.
