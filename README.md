# NR_homework1
My solutions for the first homework of the Numerical Recipes in Astrophysics course offered in winter of 2019 at the Leiden Observatory.

This homework included developing the following routines:

1.) A Poisson distribution mindful of not taking too much memory for large values of (lambda, k).

2.) Random number generator using a combination of (M)LCG and a 64-bit XOR-shift.

3.) Integration using Simpson's method.

4.) Linear and cubic spline interpolation in log-log space.

5.) Differentiation using Ridders' method.

6.) Rejection sampling to create N satellites with an appropriate radial distribution in spherical coordinates.

7.) Root-finding algorithm using Newton-Raphson method.

8.) Finding percentiles using a mergesort algorithm.

9.) Trilinear interpolation.

10.) Finding a global minimum in 3D space using the simplex method (needs work).
