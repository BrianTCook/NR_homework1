# NR_homework1
My solutions for the first homework of the Numerical Recipes in Astrophysics course offered in winter of 2019 at the Leiden Observatory.

This homework included developing the following routines:

A Poisson distribution mindful of not taking too much memory for large values of (lambda, k).
Random number generator using a combination of (M)LCG and a 64-bit XOR-shift
Integration using Simpson's method
Linear and cubic spline interpolation in log-log space
Differentiation using Ridders' method
Rejection sampling to create N satellites with an appropriate radial distribution in spherical coordinates
Root-finding algorithm using Newton-Raphson method
Finding percentiles using a mergesort algorithm
Trilinear interpolation
Finding a global minimum in 3D space using the simplex method (needs work)
